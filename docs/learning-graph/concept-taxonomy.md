## Design Rationale

- **Balanced Distribution:** No single category exceeds 10% of total concepts (20 concepts), ensuring even coverage
- **Pedagogical Progression:** Categories flow from foundational (FOUND, BASIC) to conversational (CONV, PRON) to vocabulary (EMOT, PEOP, FOOD, ANIM, DESC, VERB) to advanced (GRAM, CULT)
- **Age-Appropriate:** Categories align with grades 4-8 learning objectives and the 6-week course structure
- **Cultural Inclusion:** CULT category emphasizes Deaf culture awareness alongside language learning
- **Grammar Integration:** GRAM combines linguistic structure with expressive elements (facial grammar, non-manual signals)
- **Clear Boundaries:** Each category has distinct membership criteria to avoid ambiguity
